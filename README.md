A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

Welcome to my first-semester web development project, where i've brought the Community Science Museum to life online. Using our HTML and CSS skills, i've crafted a responsive website that showcases our dedication to design and functionality In this assignment, we transformed static content into an engaging digital experience, ensuring seamless interaction across devices. This project not only highlights our technical prowess but also our commitment to user experience and accessibility.

## Description from Noroff

We believe science should not be confined to the textbook but brought to life through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all.
